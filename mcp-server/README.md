# QuickBooks Online MCP Server

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for QuickBooks Online integration.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```env
QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
QUICKBOOKS_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
```

3. Get your Client ID and Client Secret:
   - Go to the [Intuit Developer Portal](https://developer.intuit.com/)
   - Create a new app or select an existing one
   - Get the Client ID and Client Secret from the app's keys section
   - Add `http://localhost:8000/callback` to the app's Redirect URIs

## Authentication

There are two ways to authenticate with QuickBooks Online:

### Option 1: Using Environment Variables

If you already have a refresh token and realm ID, you can add them directly to your `.env` file:

```env
QUICKBOOKS_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
QUICKBOOKS_REALM_ID=your_realm_id
```

### Option 2: Using the OAuth Flow

If you don't have a refresh token, you can use the built-in OAuth flow:

This will:
- Start a temporary local server
- Open your default browser automatically
- Redirect you to QuickBooks for authentication
- Save the tokens to your `.env` file once authenticated
- Close automatically when complete

## Usage

After authentication is set up, you can use the MCP server to interact with QuickBooks Online. The server provides various tools for managing customers, estimates, bills, and more.

## Available Tools

Added tools for Create, Delete, Get, Search, Update for the following entities:


- Account
- Bill Payment
- Bill
- Customer
- Employee
- Estimate

## Error Handling

If you see an error message like "QuickBooks not connected", make sure to:

1. Check that your `.env` file contains all required variables
2. Verify that your tokens are valid and not expired
